			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<img id="bio-image" src="assets/images/Caterpillar_Emoji.png" alt="Your Name">
			<p>

			"In all people I see myself, none more and not one a barley-corn less, 
			And the good or bad I say of myself I say of them. 
			<p>
			I know I am solid and sound, 
			To me the converging objects of the universe perpetually flow, 
			All are written to me, and I must get what the writing means. 
			<p>
			I know I am deathless, 
			I know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by a carpenter’s compass, 
			I know I shall not pass like a child’s carlacue cut with a burnt stick at night. 
			<p>
			I know I am august, 
			I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood, 
			I see that the elementary laws never apologize, 
			(I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I plant my house by, after all.) 
			<p>
			I exist as I am, that is enough, 
			If no other in the world be aware I sit content, 
			And if each and all be aware I sit content. 
			<p>
			One world is aware and by far the largest to me, and that is myself,
			And whether I come to my own to-day or in ten thousand or ten million years, 
			I can cheerfully take it now, or with equal cheerfulness I can wait. 
			<p>
			My foothold is tenon’d and mortis’d in granite, 
			I laugh at what you call dissolution, 
			And I know the amplitude of time."
			<p>
